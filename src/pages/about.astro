              <p>
                Established in February 2020 (Reiwa 2), Bayfront is a comprehensive service provider 
                specializing in Japanese real estate development, trading, and operational management. 
                The company is dedicated to creating high-quality lifestyles. At the same time, we provide 
                consulting services for real estate investment, financing solutions, and operational management 
                for domestic and overseas clients, along with related supporting services.
              </p>
              <p>
                In July 2024, we rebranded as "Bayfront" (前滩). The character "滩" traditionally 
                refers to the flat land formed by sediment along rivers, lakes, and seas - submerged 
                in high water and exposed in low water.
              </p>
              <p>
                "前滩" symbolizes the first piece of fertile land to experience the washing of the 
                currents. This name embodies our determination to brave the rapids and seek innovation. 
                Under the industry's established ideology of following conventions, we seek more innovative 
                thinking while maintaining compliance with laws and regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                In an environment of scarce land and limited resources, we adopt a global perspective 
                to introduce high-quality styles, integrate Japanese advantages, bridge cultural differences, 
                and apply professional investment service concepts to create unique, leisurely, comfortable, 
                and elegant personalized living spaces. We deliver our distinctive "Premium Collection" 
                service model to clients, encompassing "Premium (niche customization), Quality (quality priority), 
                and Integration (resource optimization)."
              </p>
              <p>
                BAYFRONT will gather collective momentum and expand with full force to become a focal point 
                in Japan's real estate industry.
