              <span>In July 2024, we rebranded as "Bayfront," written as "前湾" in Chinese characters. The character "湾" traditionally refers to flatlands formed by sediment deposits along rivers, lakes, and seashores—areas that submerge when water is deep and emerge when shallow. "前湾" represents the first land to be washed and permeated by water flow.</span>

            <p class="flex items-start">
              <span>True to its name, Bayfront embodies our determination to overcome rapid currents and pursue originality. Within the industry's conventional framework, we seek innovative thinking while maintaining legal and regulatory compliance. We incorporate a global perspective, leverage Japan's strengths, and provide elegant and comfortable living spaces. Since June 2024, we have held bank-certified premium real estate projects, developing various properties including towers, office buildings, commercial facilities, villas, and land.</span>

              <span>Our management team has extensive experience in financial data and services, accumulating customer resources to create our distinctive "Premium Collection" service model: "Premium" (niche customization), "Quality" (quality priority), and "Integration" (optimization).</span>
